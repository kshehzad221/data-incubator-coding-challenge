Here is the solution to the coding challenge.

The solution has two versions. Both versions are included in the notebook Coding_Challenge.ipynb and are able to handle malformed input lines.

1)  The first version takes one line of input from the user at a time and keeps running until asked to stop.
2)  The second version reads the data from a file, one line at a time.
